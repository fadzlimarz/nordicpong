# Nordic Pong

Nordic Pong reinvents the classic Pong game with an innovative automated gameplay that pits four Nordic countries—Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark—against each other in a battle to expand their territories. This game, developed using JavaScript Canvas, combines the simplicity of Pong with a new thematic twist.

To play, simply open the `html` file and watch as the countries compete in an engaging display of strategy and agility.

The concept for Nordic Pong was inspired by [@vnglst X Post](https://x.com/vnglst/status/1751278052154179770?s=20), which motivated the exploration of collision detection between circles and rectangles within a game setting.
